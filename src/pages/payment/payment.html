                Direct bank transfer is currently the only payment method we offer. We are working on implementing more
                payment options in the near future. After you transfer the money, please press the button <strong>"Money
                transferred"</strong>. This will notify the Fairlance team about your payment right away. As soon as we
                confirm the transfer the project status will be updated. This can take up to several hours.
